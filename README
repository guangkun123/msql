README for mSQL version 1.0 Patch 16	 7 Jul 1996
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


General Info
------------

mSQL has been developed under Sun OS 4.1.1 but has been tested under
Solaris 2.3, Ultrix 4.3, Linux, and OSF/1 (cc not gcc).  That said, it 
should "autoconf" and build on most BSD derived systems, SVR4 based 
systems or POSIX O/S's (that should cover most of them).  It has been
reported that it works out-of-the-box on HP-UX, NeXT, SCO, Sequent,
Cray, Tandem, *BSD  and a few others.  I haven't tested these so buyer beware.


License
---------

mSQL has been released in the past under terms known as "conscience-ware",
the basic concept of which was that companies that used the software
could contribute a small ammount to the continued development of the
software without any strict rules being placed upon such "donations".
Although the concept sounds fair, it failed badly with only 3 contributions
being made from over 3,600 copies of mSQL-1.0.5 that were ftp'ed from my
machine alone.  Over 1,000 of those copies went to commercial organisations
and I receive many questions a day from companies using mSQL behind
their WWW servers etc who are looking for free support.

In an attempt to balance this out and allow me to devote some time to
mSQL (rather than other persuits that I do to generate an income), mSQL
is now a commercial product.  I still believe in free software over the 
Internet and cooperation in research so the new license is designed not to 
hurt Universities, research groups and other people that _should_ have free
access to software.  Commercial organisations that are using this so
that they don't have to buy an Oracle or an Ingres will now have to buy
mSQL (at a minute fraction of the cost of one of the commercial
offerings).

Please read the doc/License file to see if you are required to register
your copy.  An invoice is included in both Postscript and ASCII format
to ease the generation of payments.


Installation
------------

To build mSQL, type "make target" in the top directory.  This will build
a directory where the object files for your system will be made.  This
mechanism allows you to NFS mount the sources onto different machines
and build mSQL on different platforms without having to make copies of 
the sources.  The directory will be under the "targets" directory (e.g.
$(TOP)/targets/Solaris-2.3-Sparc )

Once the target directory has been created, change directory into it and
run "setup".  That will run autoconf and some other configuration
scripts.  Some system wide configuraion items, including the language
for error moessages, are defined in common/site.h so you should probably
have a look at that file and change anything you feel needs to be
changed.

Once you've done that, just type make.  You should install the software 
with "make install" when you're happy with it.  

The default installation directory is /usr/local/Minerva.  This area is
shared by all the development of Minerva (including the ESL scripting
language and Minerva itself).  It's probably a good idea to leave it as
that rather than /usr/local/msql or similar if you wish to use ESL
(check out doc/Minerva for details on ESL or grab the ESL manual via ftp
from Bond.edu.au in /pub/Minerva/esl )


Testing the software
--------------------

Once it is installed, you can try the sample mSQL script provided in
the msql source directory.  Fire up the server using

	/usr/local/Minerva/bin/msqld&

Create a test database using

	/usr/local/Minerva/bin/msqladmin create test

Run the script through the terminal monitor using

	/usr/local/Minerva/bin/msql test < sample.msql

There are also some further test scripts in the tests directory.  The
"killer" test will produce performance figures about mSQL running on
your machine.  Details such as the number of operations per second for
inserts, fills and selects on both keyed and flat tables is generated.

The most complete test is the regressions test found in test/rtest.  Run
it using 'rtest DBname' where dbname is the name of a database it can
trash.


Notes :
	o  If you run this on a Cray (what?  you don't have a Y-MP at
	home? :) you'll have to remove -lsocket and -lx from EXTRA_LIB 
	in site.mm after you run setup.

	o If you are building this with gcc and see link errors like
	__load.o(.text+0x1a): undefined reference to `mcount'
	edit site.mm and set 'CC=gcc -static'




Further Doco
------------

A set of WWW pages for mSQL are now available in the Hughes
Technologies web site.  The URL is

	http://Hughes.com.au/

There is also a very complete FAQ maintained by Peter Samuel
(Peter.Samuel@uniq.com.au) available in both text and HTML formats via 
FTP from Bond.edu.au in /pub/Minerva/msql


Bugs / Problems
---------------

If you find what you think is a bug or you have a problem or question
you'd like answered, __please__ join the mailing list and ask your
question there.  My mailbox floweth over.  I am continually getting
messages to my private mailbox regarding old problems and other matters 
that have been discussed many times on the mailing list.  It takes a lot
of time to wade through the 100's of message I receive per week.

You can join the mailing list by sending a message containing just the
word "subscribe" to 

	msql-list-request@Bunyip.com

If you want to report a bug, please include the following :-

	Include the output of "msqladmin version"
	Include a dump of a test database using msqldump
	Include a mSQL script that will show the bug

You should also ensure that you are running the latest (stable) version
of mSQL before mailing the list as I fix bugs in every version.
