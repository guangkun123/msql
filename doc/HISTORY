	o Added support for non-root installations



mSQL 0.2 patch 3        9 - Sep - 1994
---------------------------------------

	o Added the License file to the distribution.  Make install
		was looking for it when it wasn't there.


mSQL 0.2 patch 2        8 - Sep - 1994
---------------------------------------

	o Modified the killer test script so that it can use both BSD
		and SysV styled /bin/time outputs
	o Moved the large buffer used by readKey() into the global scope
		so that it wasn't put onto the stack (small stack limits
		were failing)
	o Purify'd the sucker within an inch of it's life.  This should
		fix the problems seen on NeXTs as there were many places
		where free memory reads and the like were going on.  Huge
		levels of thanks an appreciation to Anthony Baxter for
		actually doing the Purify'ing (repeatedly) as I don't have 
		a copy.
	o Added a LINKER variable to site.mm so that a one line change
		could be made to force the use of other linkers like
		Purify.
	o Added checks to ensure that a database had been selected prior
		to performing operations such as msqlListFields() etc.
	o Added a call to msqlClean() from inside yyerror() so that the
		internal guff is cleaned if the query has a syntax
		error.
	o Fixed array bounds over-run error in writeRow() if a row
		buffer was provided.
	o Added a dummy variable info struct to the result handles
		returned by msqlListDBs() msqlListTables() so that they
		could be treated as standard query results.
	o Esured that msqlListFields() retuned a result handle with a 0
		row data table.



mSQL 0.2 patch 1	22 - Aug - 1994
---------------------------------------

	o The cache routines were often using an old global pointer into the
		table cache structure (tableDef) rather than dereferencing
		the current cache entry pointer.  This caused the server
		to often use the incorrect table defininition.


mSQL 0.2  		19 - Aug - 1994
---------------------------------------

	o Added mmap() support to readRow() and writeRow() 
	o Added primary keys to database, field definition and protocol
	o Added code to invalidate the table cache entry of a table if it
		is dropped.  This fixes the bug whereby a table could be
		recreated and the server still used the old definition.
	o Profiled selects a little to improve performance.  The parser now
		sets a flag if it sees a field wildcard in a select.  This
		ensures that expandFieldWildcards() is only called when it
		is needed.
	o Merged in par's mod's for "not null" support. 
	o Fixed bug in updateValues() introduced by the "not null" patch
	o Added checkNullFields() to utilise the new notnull field and
		byte to ensure notnull fields are in fact notnull.  An
		insert or an update will now fail if a notnull field has
		no value.
	o Added LIKE clause for char type comparisons.  The SQL regexp
		syntax is mapped into "unix" regexp syntax and Henry
		Spencer's regexp library is used for the evaluation.
	o Added trap code, puntClient(), to handle the SIGPIPE generated if 
		a client bails out after submitting a query but before the 
		result is sent (i.e. server writes down a closed socket).
	o Added support for negative int values (should have been in there
		to start with).
	o Removed case sensitivity from SQL keywords
	o API modified :-
		msqlStoreResult() added returning result*
		msqlFetchData() is now msqlFetchTable() taking result*
		msqlFetchRow() added taking result*
		msqlInitDB() now called msqlSelectDB()
		msqlConnect() takes host or NULL to revert to old behaviour
		msqlConnect() returns server socket
		all routines that talk to the server now take socket
	o API data types :-
		m_table is now m_data
		m_result added as the query result handle
	o Protocol modified :-
		now handles null's and keys
		username passed to server when msqlInitDB() called.
		field info is now returned from a select
	o Cleaned up client library and removed the references to
		debug() unless MINERVA_DEBUG defined.  Debug still
		included in the server
	o Fixed bug in real handling (had atof() returning a double)
	o Added autoconf test for sys_siglist
	o Found and fixed a bug in the table cache code that caused a
		core dump if the cache was rolled over.
	o Found and fixed one of the memory leaks in select calls
	o Implemented new data/key reading/writing mechanisms for use
		with disk files as the mmap() code had to be backed out.
		The new ones are faster than the old ones anyway.
	o Added internal debugging to the API with an internal copy of
		the debug code.
	o Added heaps more debugging to the server
		


mSQL 0.1 patch 1	5 - Jul - 1994
---------------------------------------

		The release version had problems with "make install"

---------------------------------------

	o How can there be any history!  This is the first release :-)
