Please Note !!!!!!!


mSQL is now offered to the public under a limited commercial license.
For many users, this implies that you can still use it free of charge.
For commercial users, you are required to purchase mSQL.  Please read
the License file for further details and clarification.

I have included both a Postscript and a text version of an invoice you
should use to when paying for your copy.  Credit cards are accepted (and 
prefered) so you can just fill it in and fax it to me.  Using a credit
card removes the complication of currency exchange etc.

Registrations of mSQL-1.x are helping fund the development of mSQL-2.
Without the financial support of mSQL-1 users work on mSQL-2 would never
have been started.  mSQL-2 goes a long way to moving mSQL closer to the
commercial RDBMS engines such as the Oracle and Ingres backends.  When
completed, mSQL-2 will be made available under terms similar to those
applied to mSQL-1 (i.e. free use to Universities etc).


Thanks for your support
