Minerva is an extensible network management environment I'm developing
as part of my Ph.D.  Although the primary goal has been systems and
network management, a few strange paths have been taken on the way.  The
two most notable wanderings have been the development of ESL (a C styled
scripting language offering snmp support and some other pretty funky stuff)
and Mini SQL (an implementation of a subset of ANSI SQL in a server that
is quite fast and uses very little memory).

You may be interested in the other developments of Minerva.  For
example, if you are reading this as part of the mSQL distribution, you
may want to grab a copy of ESL because there is an ESL version of the
mSQL API (i.e. SQL database access from your scripts).  

The other bits'n'pieces, as well as papers on Minerva itself, are
available from :-
